# Parse-Data-on-Network-find-Geo-Location
This web application parses the data from packets on the user's local network. With the latitude and longitude found in the data you can then enter them to pull up the Google Map location.

To avoid issues with running the project I included the entire file. I suggest downloading the finalproject file and using the executable file located in the bin folder to use this application. This project was completed on visual studios utilizing c#.
